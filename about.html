        <h1>About Cozy Café</h1>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Cozy Café was born out of a love for exceptional coffee and a vision to create a warm, inviting space for the community. Founded in 2017, our café is a labor of love by Jane Doe and John Smith, who share a passion for great coffee, delicious food, and genuine hospitality. They wanted to create a place where people could escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life, relax with a good book, catch up with friends, or simply enjoy a quiet moment.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
